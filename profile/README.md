Feel yourself guys. I just copy pasted some template shit from the ChatGPT previously.
I'm thinking there is no use in it even though its professional.

I'm into coding for past 5 years. From my collage days to present. Am I satisfied with this? Does this GitHub repos thing seems so familier like a social media?. Are we urging towards getting stars instead of likes. But everything is a reward right? What is the purpose of reward if we are doing what we like.

Are we tailored to contribute back to the society just for the sake that we learnt something from it.

I just want to express my thoughts, my stories freely without any restriction, without any hesitation. If it breaks the coding ethics, let it be. Who cares?
