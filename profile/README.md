Photograph is art of capturing moments. During my childhood, I used to take pictures with a 'Yashica' film roll camera. Its a complete manual camera with very low aperture to maintain a deep depth of field. I used to take only limited pictures even if it is a important occasion as they have only 36 exposures per film roll. And even after taking pictures, the process won't complete at all. Film development was one of the curious things to know at that time. But unfortunately no one allowed me inside the darkroom. Digital era changed everything. I bought my first digital camera when I am in my 11th grade. Its a 'Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H200', a point and shoot camera (Its still working  ðŸ˜‰). Then comes the 'Nikon D5200' and 'Dji pocket 2'. And of course a mobile phone. Its the time when I explored the in and out of camera's working principle and digital image processing (Yes, I am an Electronics and Communication Engineer). Its a point where my passion and profession met. I love to capture pictures, I love to know, how to capture pictures and I love to know how my camera is capturing pictures. ðŸ“·

# About me

I am kind of person who is passionate towards photography and vision technologies. I am working as a Software developer in the field of computer vision. I started this community to share the knowledge with respect to cameras. As a hobbyist, I am street photographer which encouraged me to explore the camera technologies from the perspective of a consumer. Yes, I am beginner and I am the one who is eager to learn so much in the field of open source vision technology development and professional photography. This is a small initiative to club both the technical and non-technical aspects of photography (from development to use case). If you have any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to share.
